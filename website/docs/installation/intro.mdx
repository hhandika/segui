# Introduction

Each version of SEGUL is self-contained. This means you can install the GUI and CLI without conflicts in any operating system that supports them. Learn more about the differences between the [GUI and CLI versions](../cli_gui).

## GUI Installation

**SEGUL GUI** supports Linux, macOS, Windows, Android, iOS, and iPadOS. Follow the [GUI installation guide](./install_gui) for more detailed instructions. Quick links for installation from the official app stores are provided below:

## CLI Installation

We provide several installation methods for the command-line interface (CLI) app. Each method has advantages and disadvantages, so we recommend choosing the one that best suits your needs.

1. Using a **pre-compiled binary** is the CLI version's quickest and most straightforward installation route. Learn more about the [pre-compiled binary installation](./install_binary).
2. Install from the **Bioconda channel**. This installation route is the fastest option for Linux and macOS users with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html) installed. Learn more about the [Bioconda installation](./install_conda).
3. Use the **Rust package manager**, [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). If you already use Rust, this installation route is the best option. The cargo install provides the most platform support. Learn more about [the cargo installation](./install_cargo).
4. Compiling it from **the source code** in the GitHub repository gives you the most up-to-date version, but the resulting binary may not be fully tested. Learn more about the [source code installation](./install_source).
5. Compiling from the **development branch**. We keep new features in the development branch until we finish testing them. This installation method will allow you to test new features before release. However, the development branch may be unstable. Learn more about the [development branch installation](./install_dev).
