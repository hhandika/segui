# Overview

We want the installation to be as flexible as possible. We offer three ways to install the app. Each of the options has pros and cons.

1. Using a pre-compiled binary. The quickest and the most straigtforward installation route.
2. Using the Rust package manager, cargo. If you already using Rust, this installation route is the best option.
3. Compiling it from the source in the Github repository. It gives you the most up to date version, but the resulting binary may not be fully tested.
4. Installing from the development branch. We keep new features in the development branch until we finish testing them. This installation method will allow you to test new features before they are released. However, the development branch may be unstable.
