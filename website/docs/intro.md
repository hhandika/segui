# Welcome

**Thank you for using SEGUL!** 🙏🏻

`segul` is an ultrafast and memory efficient phylogenomic data manipulation and summary statistics calculation.

## Why SEGUL?

1. **Fast and memory efficient**. It can process thousands of loci on a computer with limited RAM.
2. **Repeatable and reproducible**. It supports reproducible research by providing a complete log of the analysis. The CLI and GUI version combined runs on macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, iPadOS, and iOS.
3. **Easy to use**. It has a simple command line interface and a GUI app (in alpha version).
4. API support.

## Big changes in the version 0.19.0 💪🏼

- New command structure. Check [quick start](https://docs.page/hhandika/segul-docs/quick_start#cli-command-list) instruction to see the most up to date commands. We are working on updating the documentation throughout the website.
- New command to calculate summary statistics for raw reads and contigs.
- Input dir `-d` or `--dir` now can infer input format based on the file extension. No need to specify the input format anymore.
