We develop SEGUL to improve equity in evolutionary biology and strive to make it as user-friendly as possible. However, we understand you may need help with issues or have questions while using the app. This page provides several ways for you to get help and support.

## New Feature Requests, Bug Reports, and Documentation Issues

If you have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, you can submit new feature requests and bug reports directly to our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hhandika/segul/issues). We also welcome collaboration and contributions to the project. The documentation is hosted in the SEGUl GUI [repository](https://github.com/hhandika/segui). Please report an issue with the documentation on the repository's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hhandika/segui/issues) page.

We encourage you to submit new feature requests and bug reports to our GitHub Issues. This helps us keep track of the issues and feature requests more efficiently.
